#### Project Description
### Problem
Lack of Valuable Insights from Wearable Technology: While current wearable technologies have made strides in monitoring fundamental health parameters, they still fall short in providing users with the invaluable insights and holistic Fit-score they truly need to optimize their well-being.
Limited Access to Care: Inadequate healthcare access in rural areas leaves many patients isolated and struggling to receive timely medical attention. Existing wearable technologies fail to address this critical problem, as they overlook the essential factor of accessibility to healthcare services, leaving individuals.
Inefficient Appointment Scheduling and Healthcare Resource Accessibility: Patients often struggle to find nearby hospitals or clinics for consultations, diagnostics, or acquiring necessary medications, leading to delays, inconvenience, and ineffective healthcare resource allocation.
Businesses often find it difficult to market themselves to drive foot traffic. According to the US Bureau of labour statistics, traditional businesses find it hard to market themselves to consumers

### Solution
Data Collection : Collect non-invasive health data from wearable devices and sensors, including heart rate, blood pressure, True sleep, calorie, sp02, and step counts.
LSTM Training : Train the LSTM model using the preprocessed health data to capture complex patterns and dependencies in the user's health and fitness levels over time.
Real-time Data Input : Continuously feed real-time health data into the trained LSTM model, utilizing the learned weights from the training phase.
FitScore Generation :
Based on the LSTM's predictions, generate a comprehensive FitScore that provides an overall assessment of the user's current fitness status.
Actionable Recommendations : Accompany the FitScore with personalized actionable Fitscore to help users improve their fitness levels and make informed decisions.
 Health App  to provide user better interface
